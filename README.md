## SearchLight.app - Spotlight on steroids.

This is the source for the SearchLight app hosted at [http://johnholdsworth.com/searchlight.html](http://johnholdsworth.com/searchlight.html) released under an MIT license. Written as an alternative to Spotlight it is a form of visual, indexed, recursive, grep of files similar to [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/) but generally much faster as it uses the macOS metadata index. Sure, it's Objective-C but it's faster to develop if you happen to know it and I didn't want to have to contend with any o(n) carry-on with Swift strings in dealing with regex results.

Feel free to use portions of this code in your own apps and together we can perhaps motivate Apple to make Spotlight and Finder searches a good deal more useful than they currently are. If you use the code as-is however, please leave the licensing code in so I get an idea if the app is being used. The best writeup is [here](https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macg.co%2Flogiciels%2F2018%2F03%2Fsearchlight-cherche-linterieur-des-fichiers-maj-101720&edit-text=), [original french](https://www.macg.co/logiciels/2018/03/searchlight-cherche-linterieur-des-fichiers-maj-101720).

Enjoy!
